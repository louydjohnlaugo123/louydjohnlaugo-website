                    Senate President Pro Tempore and Senate Blue Ribbon Committee Chair Panfilo Lacson said there was no competition between the investigation he would lead and that of the Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI).
                     "The two efforts are not competing, but rather complementing each other. The Blue Ribbon inquiry is in aid of legislation but nothing will prevent us from forwarding whatever evidence we may gather to the ICI to assist their investigation towards prosecution.
